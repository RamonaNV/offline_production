Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----

Dec. 20, 2019 Alex Olivas (aolivas@umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

* MuonGun.Track handles sliced MCTrees
* MuonGun.MuonBundleConverter ignores secondary muons in MCTree
* EnergyDistribution and friends integrate over energy in log space for better
  numerical stability
* Update MuonPropagator to use restructured PROPOSAL API

Release V00-02-03
-----------------
* Added support for boost >= 1.63.
  For these newer versions of boost, boostnumpy has been integrated into boost
  and is not an external dependency anymore.
* Fixes issue driven by merge with unbiased branch (r160287) to extruded_polygon.py

Release V00-02-02
-----------------
* Merged from branches/unbiased-generation
* Unbiased generation with natural rates

Release V00-02-01ug
-------------------
* Unbiased generation with natural rates

V00-02-00: March 24, 2017
-------------------------
Mostly docs. Changes since 00-00-04:

* Document:

  * Methods for determining the energies of muons in simulation at arbitrary points
  * How to calculate a muon effective area from MuonGun simulation
  * List of available flux parameterizations 

* Add:

  * Generation probability parameterizations for the CORSIKA configurations used
    in IC79 (previously private to my thesis work, but that's done now)
  * Muon flux parameterizations from DPMJET, split into conventional and prompt
    components (ditto)
  * ExtrudedPolygon, a SamplingSurface formed by a convex hull around strings
    in the X-Y plane and straight sides in the Z direction. This takes the
    guesswork out of efficiently sampling on highly non-cylindrical geometries

* Remove built-in copy of boost::numpy, and instead use Martin Wolf's enhanced
  version (when available)

* Rework SamplingSurface interface for more clarity:

  - GetDifferentialArea() renamed to GetArea(): returns the area in m^2 in
    the given direction. Surfaces are no longer assumed to be azimuthally
    symmetric.

  - GetTotalArea() renamed to GetAcceptance(): now returns the product of
    area and solid angle integrated over both zenith and azimuth (i.e. the
    return value no longer needs to be multiplied by 2pi to get m^2 sr)

* Factor Surface classes out into phys-services, separating the general functionality
  (calculating areas and finding intersections) with MuonGun specific bits
  (equality comparison and flux integration)

* Give Floodlight the ability to restrict its zenith angle range

  -- Jakob van Santen

* Remove built-in copy of the weighting project in favor of the official one.
* Remove relative imports for Python 3 compatibility.

  -- David Schultz
  
* Fixed pybindings for GenerationProbability to be able to combine
  GenerationProbabilty objects with different settings in Python. I3FrameObject 
  is now the base of GenerationProbability in the pybindings and added 
  necessary pointer conversions. (reported and fixed by briedel in r134695)

---------------------------------------------------

V00-00-04

Added release notes for this project.

* Add an axial cylinder sampling surface for use in NeutrinoGenerator
* Add pybindings for I3MuonGun::GetDepth() and fix up argument order in
  EnergyDistribution
* Fix up various incompatibilities with Python 2.4 and 3
* When choosing intersection points with a cylinder, allow up-going tracks to
  intersect the bottom cap (reported by chaack)
* Fix a sign error in the projected area term for cylinders. This was important
  for extremely long cylinders. (reported by cweaver)
* Check down-track distances of stochastic losses by distance rather than time
  in Track
