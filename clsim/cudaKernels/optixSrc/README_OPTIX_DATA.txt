The obj file for the optiX version can be generated by outputing the DOM positions as csv file, as
 
x,y,z,DOMIndex,DOMId,StringId

and the string positions (only once) as

x,y,StringId


Remark on parameters:
The pill shaped one, have been simplified and modeled with paraview, not with a CAD, it is merley an approximation and not an accurate model.

The length of the string has been chosen as 2470m and the depth of the center as 735. To create strings ranging from -500m to 1970, to match the coordinates of the DOM and ice model data.



1.) put the dom.csv and domstrings.csv in the build/ folder.
2.) run pvpython from current folder
    e.g. as
    pvpython sphereGeometry.py 
    should write obj file at outpath/
